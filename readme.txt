== Description ==

Lorelle, of Lorelle on WordPress fame requested a simple reminder plugin that could be used from the administration
panel within WordPress.  I decided to deliver with this little piece of code.

Your reminders can be input through the WordPress administration interface, and you can format them in a variety
of styles.  You can change the text color, background color, and make the text bold or italic.

== Installation ==

Installation is super simple.  Follow these steps:

1. Upload nfoppreminder.php to your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
1. Activate your plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Manage your plugin under the manage tab in the administration menu.
