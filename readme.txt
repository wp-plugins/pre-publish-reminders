This plugin displays a configurable list of reminders directly below the Categories meta box in the Write Post and Write Page interface.

== Description ==

Lorelle, of Lorelle on WordPress, requested a simple reminder plugin that could be used from the administration
panel within WordPress.  I decided to deliver with this little piece of code.

Your reminders are input through the WordPress administration interface, and you can format them in a variety
of ways.  You can change the text color, background color, and make the text strong, emphasized, and underlined.

When displaying the reminders, each reminder has a checkbox that you can check to mark that you've completed 
that item.  The item will be dimmed when the checkbox is checked and undimmed when unchecked.  Use this feature 
to make sure that you've completed everything that you should have.  This checking and unchecking will not 
maintain its status if you navigate away from a post and come back.  At that point, all checkboxes will be 
unchecked and all reminders will appear.

== Installation ==

IMPORTANT UPGRADE NOTE
If you're upgrading, please deactivate the Pre-Publish Reminder plugin before installation of the new version.

Installation is super simple.  Follow these steps:

1. Upload nfoppreminder.php to your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
2. Activate your plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Manage your reminders under the Manage/Publish Reminders tab in the administration menu.
