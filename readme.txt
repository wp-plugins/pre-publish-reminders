This plugin displays a configurable list of reminders directly below the Categories meta box in the Write Post interface.

== Description ==

Lorelle, of Lorelle on WordPress fame requested a simple reminder plugin that could be used from the administration
panel within WordPress.  I decided to deliver with this little piece of code.

Your reminders are input through the WordPress administration interface, and you can format them in a variety
of ways.  You can change the text color, background color, and make the text strong, emphasized, and underlined.

When displaying the reminders, each reminder has a checkbox that you can check to mark that you've completed 
that item.  The item will be dimmed when the checkbox is checked and undimmed when unchecked.  Use this feature 
to make sure that you've completed everything that you should have.  This checking and unchecking will not 
maintain its status if you navigate away from a post and come back.  At that point, all checkboxes will be 
unchecked and all reminders will appear.
