This plugin displays a configurable list of reminders on the post administration screen.

== Description ==

Lorelle, of Lorelle on WordPress, requested a simple reminder plugin that could be used from the administration
panel within WordPress.  I decided to deliver with this little piece of code.

Your reminders are input through the WordPress administration interface, and you can format them in a variety
of ways.  You can change the text color, background color, and make the text strong, emphasized, and underlined.
Reminders are stored as posts in the database.

When displaying the reminders, each reminder has a checkbox that you can check to mark that you've completed 
that item.  The item will be dimmed when the checkbox is checked and undimmed when unchecked.  Use this feature 
to make sure that you've completed everything that you should have.  Checked reminders will stay checked after saving
a post.

== Installation ==

IMPORTANT UPGRADE NOTE
Installation is super simple.  Follow these steps:

1. Upload the pre-publish-reminders folder to your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Manage your reminders under the "Tools > Publish Reminders" tab in the administration menu
