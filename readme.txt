== Description ==

Lorelle, of Lorelle on WordPress fame requested a simple reminder plugin that could be used from the administration
panel within WordPress.  I decided to deliver with this little piece of code.

Your reminders are input through the WordPress administration interface, and you can format them in a variety
of ways.  You can change the text color, background color, and make the text bold or italic.

When displaying the reminders, each reminder has a checkbox that you can check to mark that you've completed 
that item.  The item will be dimmed when the checkbox is checked and undimmed when unchecked.  Use this feature 
to make sure that you've completed everything that you should have.  This checking and unchecking will not 
maintain its status if you navigate away from a post and come back.  At that point, all checkboxes will be 
unchecked and all reminders will appear.

== Installation ==

Installation is super simple.  Follow these steps:

1. Upload nfoppreminder.php to your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
2. Activate your plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Manage your reminders under the manage tab in the administration menu.

If you're upgrading, there's some important things to remember.  First, you need to deactivate the original
version of the plugin, then follow the instructions above.
